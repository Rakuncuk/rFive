# rFive

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) boilerplate for the popular Grand Theft Auto V mod called [FiveM](https://fivem.net/).

Traditionally you had to build your [React](https://reactjs.org/) app every time you wanted to test it in game. 

This boilerplate creates a seamless interaction layer between [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) and the [React](https://reactjs.org/) development environment to allow hot reloads.
